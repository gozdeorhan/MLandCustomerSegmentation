# ML Prediction and Customer Segmentation

This project is done in scope of a case study with the aim of predicting if the customer will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit. 

The ML algorithms achieved accuracy rates between %88-%93. 

Boruta is used as a feature selection method however it is seen that keeping all predictors are more useful thus no elimination is done with Boruta. The algorithms utilised are as follows: Decision Tree, Random Forest and single layer Neural Network. 

For predicting the desired outcome, it is seen that age, existing loans, education and marital status are important features with significant predictive powers.

In addition, a customer segmentation is done. It is seen that the customers who made the term deposit commitment is mostly in cluster number 1 and 2, thus they can be more inclined to buy new products! Focusing on group 1 and 2 may be more profitable for clients.
